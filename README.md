# Algorithm Sorting Project

This project implements several sorting algorithms using HTML and JavaScript. The implemented algorithms include Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each algorithm along with instructions on how to use this project.




## Algorithms implemented

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half separately, and then merges the sorted halves together.

## Quick Sort

Quick Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

## Heap Sort

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a binary heap from the input array and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until the array is sorted.

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two parts: the sub-array of items already sorted and the sub-array of items remaining to be sorted. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

## Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through the input array, removing one element per iteration and finding the place to insert it into the sorted portion of the array.

## Usage

- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Open the index.html file in a web browser.
- Select the desired sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Input the array of elements you want to sort into the provided text box.
- Click the "Sort" button.
- The sorted array will be displayed below the input box.

## File Structure

- index.html: The main HTML file containing the user interface elements.
- styles.css: CSS file for styling the user interface.
- sorting.js: JavaScript file containing the implementations of the sorting algorithms and the logic for user interaction.
- Algorithms folder for storing the algorithms.
